# TUM ESM SliDev Template

## What is it?

[SliDev](https://sli.dev/) is a markdown presentation tool. A mixture of Latex and Powerpoint. You can write presentations in markdown without worrying about the styling or formatting. SliDev will turn a markdown file into a presentation.

You can fully make use of HTML, but you don't have to. Below, there is an instruction on how this project is set up.

## How run it?

Run these scripts in the root project directory (which contains the `README.md` file).

-   `bash scripts/install.sh`: Install node dependencies
-   `bash scripts/develop.sh`: Run slidev in development mode (slides opened browser with hot reload)
-   `bash scripts/export.sh`: Export slides from `src/slides.md` to `slides.pdf`
